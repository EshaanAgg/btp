# BTP

This repository contains the various notebooks and mini-projects that I build as a part of learning NLP for my BTP in the 6-7th semester.

## Current Implementations

- [Sentiment Analysis](./SentimentAnalysis.ipynb): Introduction to NLP, NN and word embeddings with the help of binary-classification of the sentiments of reviews (postive/negative) from multiple sources.
- [Generate Text](./GenerateText.ipynb): Uses RNN and LSTM to generate text based on a prompt. The model is trained on Shakespeare's plays, and thus is writes in the form of the same. You can also find the [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Jci63mQE_CtEJVF6JsykZgujjAQuq3VF?usp=sharing) of this notebook here, which I recommed for running the actual computations.
