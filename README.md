# BTP

This repository contains the various notebooks and mini-projects that I build as a part of learning NLP for my BTP in the 6-7th semester.

## Current Implementations

- [Sentiment Analysis](./SentimentAnalysis.ipynb): Introduction to `NLP`, `Neural Networks` and word embeddings with the help of binary-classification of the sentiments of reviews (postive/negative) from multiple sources.
- [Generate Text](./GenerateText.ipynb): Uses `RNN` and `LSTM` to generate text based on a prompt. The model is trained on Shakespeare's plays, and thus is writes in the form of the same. You can also find the same on [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Jci63mQE_CtEJVF6JsykZgujjAQuq3VF?usp=sharing) to run the actual computations.
- [Tweet Analysis](./TweetAnalysis.ipynb): Uses the previously learnt techniques as well as `BERT` to predict the presence of sarcasm in a relatively sort dataset of just `500` tweets. You can also find the same on [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FHB56789Jsq0PBXc-LAe43KNdO1HKPar?usp=sharing) for running the GPU intensive computations.
